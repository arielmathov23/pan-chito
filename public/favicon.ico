<!-- 
To create a proper favicon.ico file:
1. Use the SVG file (favicon.svg) to generate a multi-size ICO file
2. You can use online converters like https://convertio.co/svg-ico/ or https://favicon.io/
3. Upload the SVG and download the ICO file
4. Replace this placeholder file with the downloaded ICO file

The ICO format is needed for older browsers that don't support SVG favicons.
