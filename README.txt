ICON REQUIREMENTS

To complete the extension, please create the following icon files:

1. icon16.png - 16x16 pixels
2. icon48.png - 48x48 pixels 
3. icon128.png - 128x128 pixels

You can create these icons using any image editing software. The icons should be:
- Simple and recognizable
- Related to the extension's purpose (copying/pasting between 021 and Lovable)
- A purple/violet color scheme would match the existing UI

For a quick solution, you could create a simple icon with:
- "021" text on one side
- An arrow pointing to "L" (for Lovable) on the other side
- Use the same purple (#8b5cf6) as in the extension's UI

Once created, place the PNG files in this directory.
